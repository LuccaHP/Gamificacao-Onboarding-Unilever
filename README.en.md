As students at <a href="https://www.inteli.edu.br/" target="_blank">**Inteli - Institute of Technology and Leadership**</a>, we had the opportunity to develop an incredible project: the "Unilever City". Inteli is more than an educational institution, it's a place where we are encouraged to apply our skills in real contexts and face complex challenges.

Here at Inteli, we are trained to be effective leaders in the world of technology. We learn to work in teams, think critically and solve complex problems. And "Unilever City" is a perfect example of this.

Developed in response to a real need at Unilever, this game transcends entertainment. It represents a valuable educational and informational tool for new Unilever employees, providing a solid and comprehensive preparation for a successful journey within the company.

We are proud of what we have achieved with this project and are excited to share it with you. We invite you to explore "Unilever City" and see for yourself what we are able to accomplish when we apply our knowledge and skills in a real context.

Welcome to Unilever City, an initiative conceived in response to a real need at Unilever, with the participation of talented students from class 2024.1 at Inteli - Institute of Technology and Leadership. This project was developed with the aim of instructing and guiding new employees in Unilever's IT area, providing them with comprehensive preparation to successfully integrate into the company, while offering an immersive, hands-on experience that not only entertains, but also educates and informs.
<br>
### **🔍 The problem:** 
Training new employees at Unilever can be challenging, especially for those in IT, due to the complexity of operations and the company's vast range of products and brands.
<br>
<br>
### **🎯 The goal:** 
To offer players a unique opportunity to immerse themselves in the vibrant and dynamic world of Unilever, learning about the company and its main brands, as well as taking part in training sessions, all while embarking on a challenging mission: to recover the lost parts of the company's emblematic "U". In addition, the game seeks to familiarize players with Unilever's core values and commitments, such as sustainability, inclusion and innovation.
<br>
<br>
### **🧩 The target audience:** 
New employees in Unilever's IT department, as well as anyone interested in learning more about the company and its values.
<br>
<br>

Developed as part of the Inteli curriculum, this project is more than just a game. It is proof of the students' potential to apply their skills in a real context and face complex challenges. At the same time, it serves as a valuable tool to prepare future Unilever employees, giving them an authentic insight into the company's culture and values.

We therefore invite you to explore Unilever City, where adventure, learning and fun meet. Get ready for an exciting journey as you discover what it means to be part of one of the world's largest companies and how you can contribute to a better future.

# 📁 Folder structure

The efficient organization of files and folders is fundamental to the successful management and development of any project. In this section, we present the folder structure adopted for the Unilever City project, offering a comprehensive overview of the arrangement of files and their function within the context of the game's development.

Each directory and subdirectory plays a specific role in organizing and storing the different types of resources, from source code to visual and audio assets. By understanding the folder structure, team members and external collaborators can easily navigate through the files, facilitating development, maintenance and collaboration on the project.

```bash
├── .vscode           # VS Code settings
├── assets            # General project resources
│ ├── assetsREADME    # General README resources
│ ├── npcs            # Resources related to NPCs (non-playable characters)
│ ├── 4.1             # Resources for section 4.1 of the GDD
├── assetsREADME      # README resources
├── document          # Project documentation
│ └── other           # Other related documents
└── src               # Project source code
 ├── assets           # Specific game assets
 ├── configs          # Project settings
 │ └── celular        # Mobile-specific settings within the game
 ├── inicio           # Code related to the start of the game
 ├── mapas            # Code related to the game maps
 ├── minigames        # Code for minigames
 │ ├── Hack           # 'Hack' minigame code
 │ └── memoria        # Code for the 'Memory' minigame
 ├── plugin           # Code for game plugins
 └── scenes           # Game scenes code
```
The files and folders at the root of the project include:

<span id="assets"></span> <b>assets:</b> This folder contains all the unstructured resources related to the project, such as images, audio and other visual elements used in the game.

<span id="document"></span> <b>document:</b> This folder contains all the project documents, including the Game Design Document (GDD), as well as complementary documents. In addition, there is an "other" subfolder for additional documents.

<span id="src"></span> <b>src:</b> Here is all the source code developed for the creation of the game project. All the classes, scripts and files related to the game's logic and functionality are contained in this folder.

<span id="readme.md"></span> <b>README.md:</b> This file serves as a guide and general explanation of the project, its characteristics, purpose and important information for collaborators and users of the game.

The folder structure is the skeleton that supports the entire development of the Unilever City project. From the organization of source code to the storage of visual and audio assets, each folder plays a crucial role in maintaining order and facilitating the team's workflow.

By following a well-defined and intuitive structure, we ensure that all team members can quickly locate the resources they need and understand the context in which they are working. This promotes effective collaboration, reduces the time spent searching for files and contributes to a more fluid and productive development experience.

In short, the folder structure is more than just a physical organization of files - it's the backbone of our development process, providing a solid foundation for creating an exceptional game and a memorable experience for players.
